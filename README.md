# Assignment Description:
Your group (3) will be given 1 week, to design and implement a gallery that advertises new
releases for the Bluray site. You can use any of the existing movie poster images, and use
a previous example of a Javascript gallery (this assignment is about collaboration and use
of Git, not the code itself).
# Assignment Requirements:
Each team member will create a GIT account. 1 member will host the files and the others
will collaborate on that repository. The working structure of the code base will be as
follows. 1 master, 1 dev and 3 sandbox branches. All code must be merged through the
dev to master branches.
